          e.quinox is a student-led humanitarian organisation with the objective of uplifting rural Rwandan communities through sustainable, self-sufficient and scalable solutions.
        </p>
        <p class="bottomPara font20" style="color:yellowgreen">
        We bridge the gap between NGOs and industrial practice, fostering collaboration in the fields of sustainable energy and international development. 
        </p>
        <p class="bottomPara font16">
        Through first-hand work with the people of Rwanda, we understand the wants and needs of the locals and how we can work together to advance their lifestyle. This is how we have successfully developed and delivered several lasting projects on the ground for 15 years.

          <p class="expeditionDesc font16 green">Most recently, in 2024 a team went to Rwanda to introduce an initiative aiming to improve the quality and quantity of water access. This project brought rainwater harvesting to homes - offering a scalable, accessible and transportable solution to improve water access across rural Rwanda.  
            <br><br>
            They received guidance from Rwanda's Ministry of Infrastructure, as well as the opportunity to collaborate with the Dean of Engineering at the University of Rwanda. This allowed e.quinox to receive invaluable feedback that will influence their design and engineering choices going forward. </p>
