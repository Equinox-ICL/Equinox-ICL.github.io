In 2024, the team returned to Rwanda to conduct feasibility studies on three initiatives that had emerged from conversations with the community and stakeholders during the 2022 expedition: Mushroom Farming, Project Amazi, and Truckle. After detailed evaluation, only Project Amazi proved feasible, and it is now being taken forward. The project focuses on bringing rainwater harvesting to households—offering a scalable, accessible, and transportable solution to alleviate water stress across rural Rwanda.

During this visit, the team worked closely with Rwanda’s Ministry of Infrastructure and collaborated with the Dean of Engineering at the University of Rwanda. Their guidance and feedback have been invaluable in shaping the design and engineering choices as the project develops. The team is now building a prototype with the aim of launching a pilot in Minazi, with the long-term vision of scaling Project Amazi to benefit communities across the country.
